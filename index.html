            <p id="mainP" class="main__p">Starting with Drama classes at the age of 4, she had showed my family how much she loved preforming arts and acting. She took musical comedy (theater) for 8 years (4 to 11) and each of those years preformed in 1 or 2 plays per year. She got graduated of Musical Comedy at the age of 9, with her first lead role, playing the role of ‘Belen’ in ‘A Christmas Story’ the musical. 
                With that, at the age of 13, when COVID-19 started, she had get more interested in acting for screen and modeling, and started studying acting for screen, had done her first headshots, and start doing auditions. 
                In 2021, she got her fist modeling job. 
                That year she worked with some of te leader brands for teens in Argentina, including 47Street, Como Quieres, Buddies, FP Argentina, and others. She did a couple of photoshots with photographers, and she was featured in her first print magazine, Bahia Kids Magazine.
